Louise should lower the goal for her campign in the UK and in the United States.

### Challenge
Based on the data, launch date and goals do, in fact affect the outcome. For instance, in our chart "Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart" it is clear that the best time to launch a program was in 2015. Also, when looking at the "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart, a goal below $30,000 showed the most successful outcomes. ![Outcomes_Based_On_Launch_Date_Chart] (path/to/Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart.png) ![Outcomes_Based_On_Goals] (path/to/Outcomes_Based_On_Goals)
